# AENN-nowcasting (This file is still under improvement)
Extreme-value Neural Networks for Weather Forecasting  

If you want to run this code, you can change the paths in [config.py](https://github.com/zywang1603/AENN-nowcasting/blob/master/precipitation_forecasting/config.py), and then run [testrun0401.py](https://github.com/zywang1603/AENN-nowcasting/blob/master/precipitation_forecasting/testrun0401.py)

Training Process:  

Training set: 40,000 events selected from rainy events between 2008-2017Â  

Validation set: 362 extreme events in 2018  

Testing set: 657 extreme events in the whole available area from 2019 to 2021  

Stop running: When the validation reconstruction loss does not improve in 15 epoches.
